                            Lease administration is essentially the management of contracts in the real estate sector.
                            It comprises administrating all the tasks that are part of the firm’s lease portfolio.
                            Effective lease administration software helps in reducing risks by ensuring compliance with
                            lease terms, tracking key dates, and providing insights into portfolio performance. By
                            centralizing lease data, organizations can mitigate risks related to missed obligations,
                            financial discrepancies, and legal issues.

                            Additionally, it facilitates better reporting and analytics, enabling organizations to make

                            IFRS 16. This integration reduces the risk of financial misstatements and enhances
                            transparency across the organization.
